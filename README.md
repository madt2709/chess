# Chess

The aim of this repo is to build a "basic" chess engine.

We will broadly follow the approach outlined here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/simple-chess-ai-step-by-step-1d55a9266977/. 

We will use the python chess library so that we can focus on the "interesting" part of creating an engine. The library can be found here: https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess.
